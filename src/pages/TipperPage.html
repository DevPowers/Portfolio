  <p id="tribute-info">Dave Tipper or "Tipper" is a world class British electronic music producer who sets the standard for what it means to be an artist.
    His music places the listener in a three dimensional sonic soundscape consisting of high-definition unique sounds and beats, that I promise you've never heard anything like before.
    Seeing him live you'll be treated with what could be a number of different styled sets including uptempo, trip-hop, downtempo or ambient that are filled with unreleased music.
    Each set he performs is totally unique and will feature a video DJ who performs live visuals on a large stage from behind. Festival goers at some shows have even been surprised with visuals spanning the entire ceiling with Tipper upfront scratching on fresh vinyl.
  </p>
  <p>Let me tell you about your typical big name producer. They have a marketing team, a PR team and a label all centered around one thing. Making money.
    They want to fill the venue to the brim with as many people as possible because you aren't a fan to them, you're just a dollar sign. Build the brand, sell the merchandise and fill the seats with as many people as possible.
    Release an album and tour the world playing the same set on repeat with as many lights as possible to wow the audience. No real art of dedication behind it, the music follows a formula that they know works, so why experiment.
    If you really listen to the music, really listen..is the production quality there? Maybe it is, or maybe not. </p>
  <p>
    Some of the things that make Tipper stand out:
  <ul>
    <li>Unique sets with a plethora of unreleased new music</li>
    <li>No PR team or typical 'brand building'</li>
    <li>When he hosts a festival:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Tickets are limited to keep it small and intimate.</li>
      <li>Single stage so every artist gets a shot</li>
      <li>Visuals are all done live by world class artists</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Totally off social media, no drama. Just music.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>If you've made it this far and are still interested, please allow me to recommend you some of my personal favorite albums from the legend himself. Broken Soul Jamboree, Jettison Mind Hatch, and TipHop DJ Mix will not steer you wrong.
    Quality headphones are recommended to take advantage of the high-fidelity sonic soundscape his music provides, this is a rare intersection where the audiophile and electronic music world meet. Enjoy :].  </p>
